# OmniCaster

Cast **any spell with any catalyst** in ELDEN RING — staffs cast incantations,
seals cast sorceries — and make spell damage **scale with whatever you're
holding** (or, optionally, with your highest casting stat).

A native DLL that patches the game's param tables in memory after they load.
No `regulation.bin` edits, no files replaced — remove the DLL and everything
is vanilla again. **Offline use only** (EasyAntiCheat must be disabled; the
usual mod loaders handle that).

## Features

- **Cross-casting** (`cast_anything = 1`): every staff and seal can cast both
  sorceries and incantations.
- **Unified scaling** (`scaling_mode = equipped`, the default): a spell's
  power comes from the catalyst in your hand. Incantations cast with a staff
  use that staff's sorcery scaling; sorceries cast with a seal use that
  seal's incant scaling. Upgrade levels count (a +25 staff empowers incants
  just as much as sorceries).
- **Highest-stat mode** (`scaling_mode = highest_stat`): every catalyst
  scales *both* spell types off the higher of your INT and FAI. Uses your
  **effective** stats — talismans, the physick, and buffs that raise INT/FAI
  count. It follows the currently loaded character rather than the
  character-select/menu copy. Tracked live: load another character, level up,
  respec, or swap a stat talisman and the scaling stat flips within ~1 second.

## What is deliberately NOT changed

- **Stat requirements**: a sorcery still needs its INT and an incantation its
  FAI to cast, and catalysts keep their wield requirements. (Use a spell
  requirement mod alongside if you want those gone.)
- **School boost passives** stay type-bound: Gravel Stone Seal still boosts
  only dragon incants, the Academy Glintstone Staff only full-moon
  sorceries, etc.
- **Hybrid catalysts** (Prince of Death's Staff, Golden Order Seal, …) work
  naturally in `equipped` mode — their dual-stat scaling is mirrored as-is.
  In `highest_stat` mode they become single-stat like everything else
  (that's what "highest stat" means); secondary non-casting stats such as
  the Dragon Communion Seal's arcane keep working.

## Install

1. Copy `release\OmniCaster.dll` and `release\OmniCaster.ini` into your DLL
   mod loader's mods directory (me3 / ModEngine2 / elden_mod_loader).
2. Edit `OmniCaster.ini` if you want a different scaling mode.
3. Play offline.

A log is written to `logs\OmniCaster.log` next to the DLL. Set
`[debugging] dump = 1` to log every catalyst that gets patched, by name.

## Build

Requirements: Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop C++), CMake 3.15+.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
build.bat
```

Output lands in `release\OmniCaster.dll`. [libER](https://github.com/Dasaav-dsv/libER)
is statically linked; weapon names from
[Paramdex](https://github.com/soulsmods/Paramdex) are embedded at build time.

## How it works

Spell power in ELDEN RING is the catalyst's hidden elemental attack rating:
sorceries multiply by the weapon's **magic** attack power, incantations by
its **holy** attack power. OmniCaster mirrors each catalyst's real side onto
the other across the three tables that produce that rating:

| Param table | What's mirrored |
|---|---|
| `EquipParamWeapon` | `attackBaseMagic` ↔ `attackBaseDark`, scaling curve ids, plus the `enableMagic`/`enableMiracle` cast-permission flags |
| `AttackElementCorrectParam` | which stats (INT/FAI/…) feed each element, with their influence rates |
| `ReinforceParamWeapon` | per-upgrade-level growth of the mirrored element |

Correction rows shared with non-catalyst weapons are detected and skipped
(logged) so melee scaling can't be corrupted. `highest_stat` mode
additionally reads your **effective** INT/FAI (the exact numbers the status
screen shows, gear and buffs included) from the current in-world `PlayerIns`.
The mod reads that character's base stats and the INT/FAI corrections on its
active game effects, then polls the result once a second. This is necessary
because `PlayerGameData`'s stored “effective” block does not include every
live correction (Godrick's Great Rune is one observed example).

## Overhaul mods (Convergence, Reforged, …)

Should broadly work: nothing is hardcoded to vanilla weapon ids. Catalysts
are found by their cast-permission flags, so an overhaul's new staffs/seals
are picked up automatically (they show as `#<id>` in the log — names come
from the vanilla list). Catalysts that natively cast both spell types (like
the vanilla Staff of the Great Beyond, or overhaul hybrids) are deliberately
left untouched — their scaling is the overhaul designer's. Two caveats:

- If the overhaul ships its own DLL that rewrites the same catalyst params at
  runtime, last-writer wins; OmniCaster applies once at startup and doesn't
  fight back (except `highest_stat`'s stat flips).
- Correction rows an overhaul shares between catalysts and melee weapons are
  skipped for safety (check the log for `shared with non-catalyst` warnings —
  those weapons keep their overhaul scaling for cross-cast spells).

## Known caveats

- **Menu display**: the equipment screen shows a single "Sorcery Scaling"
  line on every catalyst (the UI picks one label; it can't be changed via
  params). Cosmetic only — the number shown applies to both spell types,
  since both sides are mirrored to the same value.
- `scaling_mode = off` + `cast_anything = 1` lets you cast cross-type spells,
  but they'll hit like wet noodles (the catalyst has ~0 attack rating for the
  foreign element). Use `equipped` unless you know what you're doing.
- Casting animations come from the catalyst you're holding (staff animations
  for incants, chime animations for sorceries).
- The Carian Sorcery Sword shares its stat-correction row with regular melee
  weapons, so it's skipped there (see the log): incantations cast with it get
  its flat holy rating but won't gain INT scaling. Every dedicated staff/seal
  is unaffected.
- In-memory only: must be re-applied by the loader every launch (automatic),
  and incompatible with anything that expects vanilla catalyst params.
